# Kanban In Action - errata

This is the errata-site for the book Kanban In Action. Please help us find the errors and make the next edition even better.

## Noticed - not yet fixed:
- Page xxi, Introduction, second bullet  
```Part 4, 'Teaching kanban' ...```  

should be  

```removed since there's no part 4 in the book.```  
- Page 56, Chapter 2, Last cartoon  
  ```You don’t! Read more about this in chapter 4, and adjust as needed.```  

  should be  
  
  ```You don’t! Read more about this in chapter 6, and adjust as needed```  

- Better diagram for Context switching effects. Make each project a separate staple in the diagram to show that with two projects it's actually just 40% EACH. Right now it looks like it's just 40% spent on projects. 

## Fixed in upcoming manuscipt
- Ah, well... nothing yet. This is just a placeholder
