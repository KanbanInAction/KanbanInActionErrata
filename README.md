# Kanban In Action - errata

This is the errata-site for the book Kanban In Action. Please help us find the errors and make the next edition even better.

## Noticed - not yet fixed:
- Page xxi, Introduction, second bullet  
```Part 4, 'Teaching kanban' ...```  

should be  

```removed since there's no part 4 in the book.```  
- Page 56, Chapter 2, Last cartoon  
  ```You don’t! Read more about this in chapter 4, and adjust as needed.```  

  should be  
  
  ```You don’t! Read more about this in chapter 6, and adjust as needed```  

- Better diagram for Context switching effects. Make each project a separate staple in the diagram to show that with two projects it's actually just 40% EACH. Right now it looks like it's just 40% spent on projects. 
- Limiting WIP by story points needs better explaination.

Hi Minglan, 

You can do what you feel is best. In our example, i would say that we’re actually missing a WIP limit above the testing column as well, maybe testing is done just for 5 points. So an additional “Ready to test” might be needed as well. 

But more likely I would do this for teams that work together for the entire development process (from requirements to production). For example, one team that I coached at Spotify consisted of both business experts, developers and testers. 
Every Monday they added about 20 points worth of work to do during the week and then went working. Some of it could be started by the testers, other items needed to be looked at by the business people before the developers started to work on it. 

So it would be like doing a sprint planning and add things to do up to a certain limit, for the entire team. 

I hope this answers your questions. I’ll add this as something we need to clarify in the next edition of the book. 

Thank you for the pointers!
